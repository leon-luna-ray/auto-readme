  ## Usage
  This application runs on node js from the command line. Once cloned to your machine, open the folder with the index.js file in your integrated terminal and run the command 'node index.js.' Inquirer will then prompt you for all of the questions for what to include in your readme and create the new md file. See the video link below!
