# Auto ReadMe

## Description

A command-line style application to seamlessly create a new ReadMe file for your projects quickly! This application will ask you all the right questions to generate a professional quality readme from the command line.

This project originally started as a Node.js command line application. I have since refactored it to become a frontend web application for easy access.
